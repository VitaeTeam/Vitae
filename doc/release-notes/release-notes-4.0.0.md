PIVX Core version *v4.0.0* is now available from:  <https://github.com/pivx-project/pivx/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/pivx-project/pivx/issues>


Mandatory Update
==============

PIVX Core v4.0.0 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will need to update their clients before enforcement of this update goes into effect.

Update enforcement is currently scheduled to go into effect at the following time:

```
Mainnet: Sunday, January 5, 2020 12:00:00 AM GMT
```

Masternodes will need to be restarted once both the masternode daemon and the controller wallet have been upgraded.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/PIVX-Qt (on Mac) or pivxd/pivx-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

PIVX Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). PIVX Core software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

PIVX Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.


Notable Changes
==============

New Wallet UI
-------------------

v4.0.0 introduces a completely new GUI for the wallet, designed and coded from the ground up by the [Krubit](https://krubit.com/) team.

This new UI, aside from the overall design large implementation, includes user-focused improvements and features such as a brief introduction on first load, a FAQ section, one-click QRCode compatible receiving addresses, masternode creation wizard, dark and light themes, filterable staking charts, and much more.

You can read more details about this extensive work in ([PR #954](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/954))

There are some legacy features that have not been included, however, notably the in-wallet block explorer and the governance page. The in-wallet block explorer was sorely outdated, and the governance page was a newer addition that will be seeing a return in a future version.

Cold Staking
-------------------

A brand new feature is being introduced with the release of v4.0.0: Cold Staking ([PR #955](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/955))! This feature allows a coin owner to keep coins in a "cold" (or locked) wallet whilst a "hot" wallet carries out the burden of staking those coins.

This brings added security to coin owners as they are no longer required to use an unlocked or partially unlocked wallet (with the ability to spend coins anywhere) in order to gain staking rewards. Users who have chosen to store their coins on hardware devices such as a Ledger or Trezor<sup>1</sup> can also gain staking rewards with those coins.

A full technical writup is available on the [PIVX Wiki](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/wiki/ColdStaking), and an initial video showcase is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utxB5TzAeXc).
A brief guide to setup cold staking with GUI and RPC is available [here](https://github.com/random-zebra/PIVX-Wiki/blob/master/User-Documentation/Cold-Staking-HowTo.md).

<sup>1</sup> Spending cold stakes from HW wallets currently available only for Ledger devices via [PET4L](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PET4L) tool.

Multi-Split Stake Splitting
-------------------

Stake splitting has received a makeover and now supports splitting to more than two (2) outputs. [PR #968](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/968) introduced the change, which is controlled by the wallet's `stakesplitthreshold` setting.

The default split threshold remains at 2000 PIV, and can be adjusted in the GUI's Settings page, or via the RPC `setstakesplitthreshold` command.

For a real example, with a stake split threshold of 1500, and a UTXO of 4708.1557; the current stake split algorithm would break that into two outputs of approximately 2355.07785. With this new logic; it will be broken into 3 outputs instead of two; each sized 1570.0519 (4708.1557 input + 2 stake = 4710.1557 / 3 outputs = 1570.0519.

The maximum number of outputs is currently capped at 48. Also, in relation to the new Cold Staking feature described above; the stake split threshold is set by the staker wallet and **NOT** the owner wallet.

New Consensus Rules
-------------------

The following consensus rule changes will be enforced on or shortly after block `2153200`. Note that **Upgrade Enforcement** (mentioned above) will occur prior to this block height.

### V1 zPIV Spending (Public Spends Version 4)

Since the discovery of a critical exploit within the libzerocoin library in early 2019, remaining legacy v1 zPIV have been un-spendable. We're happy to say that, once the new consensus rules are in effect, users will once again be able to spend their v1 zPIV with public spends version 4 ([PR #936](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/936)).

As with the previous version 3 public spends introduced in core wallet version 3.3.0 (enabling the spending of v2 zPIV), version 4 spends will also be public. A full technical writeup is available on the [PIVX Wiki](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/wiki/CoinRandomnessSchnorrSignature).

### OP_CHECKCOLDSTAKEVERIFY and P2CS

Cold staking introduces a new opcode, `OP_CHECKCOLDSTAKEVERIFY`, in the scripting language, and a new standard transaction type using it, named `P2CS` (Pay-To-Cold-Staking). A P2CS script is defined as follows:
```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_ROT OP_IF OP_CHECKCOLDSTAKEVERIFY [HASH160(stakerPubKey]
OP_ELSE [HASH160(ownerPubKey)] OP_ENDIF OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```
`OP_CHECKCOLDSTAKEVERIFY` is used to ensure that the staker can only spend the output in a valid coinstake transaction (using the same P2CS script in the new output).

### Time Protocol v2

[#PR1002](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/1002) introduces a new time protocol for the Proof-Of-Stake consensus mechanism, to ensure better efficiency, fairness and security. The time is now divided in 15-seconds slots and valid blocktimes are at the beginning of each slot (i.e. the block timestamp's seconds can only be `00`, or `15`, or `30` or `45`).<br>
The maximum future time limit is lowered from 3 minutes to 14 seconds and the past limit is set to the previous blocktime (i.e. a block can no longer have a timestamp earlier than its previous block).<br>
This means that, when looking for a valid kernel, each stakeable input can be hashed only once every 15 seconds (once per timeslot), and it is not possible to submit blocks with timestamp higher than the current time slot. This ultimately enables the removal of the "hashdrift" concept.<br>

**NOTE:** Given the much stricter time constraints, a node's clock synchronization is required for P2P connections: the maximum time offset is 15 seconds and peers with a time drift higher than 30 seconds (in absolute value) will be outright disconnected.

 For advanced users, we recommend the setup of NTP clients and own servers. This will provide to your node a higher level of time accuracy and the best, time wise, synchronization with the peers in the network.

### Block Version 7

[#PR1022](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/1022) defines Version 7 blocks, which remove the (now-unused) accumulator checkpoint from the block header. This results in an overall data reduction of ~256 bits from each block as well as the in-memory indexes.

### New Network Message Signatures

Layer 2 network messages (MN, Budget, Spork, etc) are now signed based on the hash of their **binary** content instead of their **string** representation ([#PR1024](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/1024)).

### New SPORKS

Two new SPORKS are introduced, `SPORK_17` ([#PR975](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/975)) and `SPORK_18` ([#PR995](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/995)).<br>
`SPORK_17` (off by default) is used to activate the [Cold Staking](#cold-staking) protocol. When this spork is off, no cold-staked block is accepted by the network and new delegations are rejected, but coin-owners are still able to spend previously created pay-to-cold-stake delegations.

`SPORK_18` (off by default) is used to switch between Version 3 and [Version 4 Public Spends](#v1-zpiv-spending-public-spends-version-4). When this spork is active, only version 4 spends are accepted by the network. When it's not, only version 3 spends are accepted.

RPC Changes
--------------

### New options for existing wallet commands

A new (optional) argument, `includeDelegated`, has been added to the following commands that allows these commands to include delegated coins/information in their operation:
- `getbalance` - Boolean (Default: True)
- `sendfrom` - Boolean (Default: False)
- `sendmany` - Boolean (Default: False)
- `listtransactions` - Boolean (Default: True)

Additionally, a new (optional) argument, `includeCold`, has been added to the `listtransactions` command (Boolean - Default: True), which allows for filtering of cold-staker delegated transactions.

### New return fields for existing commands

The `validateaddress` command now includes an additional response field, `isstaking`, to indicate wither or not the specified address is a cold staking address.

The `getwalletinfo` command now includes two additional response fields:
- `delegated_balance` - PIV balance held in P2CS contracts (delegated amount total).
- `cold_staking_balance` - PIV balance held in cold staking addresses.

### Newly introduced commands

The following new commands have been added to the RPC interface:
- `getnewstakingaddress`
- `delegatestake`
- `rawdelegatestake`
- `getcoldstakingbalance`
- `delegatoradd`
- `delegatorremove`

Snapcraft Packages
------------------

For our linux users, in addition to the [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~pivx) repository, we are now offering a [Snap package](https://snapcraft.io/pivx-core) as quick way to install and update a PIVX wallet.

Release versions are available via the `Stable` branch, and (for testing-only purposes) nightly builds are available in the `Beta` branch.

Internal Miner/Staker Change
--------------

The wallet's internal miner/staker is no longer prevented from running prior to having synced all the additional layer 2 (MN/Budget) data. Instead, mining/staking uses better logic to allow block creation without fully synced layer 2 data when the full data set wouldn't be required.

In other words, try to stake a new block only if:

- full layer 2 sync is complete
OR
- The spork list is synced and all three sporks (8,9 and 13) are **not** active.

Faster Shutdown During Initial Loading
--------------

Previously, if a user wanted to close/quit the wallet before it had finished its initial loading process, they would need to wait until that loading process actually completed before the wallet would fully close.

Now, the new behavior is to gracefully close the wallet once the current step is complete.
