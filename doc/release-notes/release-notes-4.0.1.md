PIVX Core version *v4.0.1* is now available from:  <https://github.com/pivx-project/pivx/releases>

This is a new revision version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/pivx-project/pivx/issues>


Recommended Update
==============

PIVX Core v4.0.1 is NOT a mandatory update, and user can choose to stay with v4.0.0 if they wish. However, v4.0.1 does contain minor bug fixes and performance improvements to address feedback from the v4.0.0 version.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/PIVX-Qt (on Mac) or pivxd/pivx-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

PIVX Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). PIVX Core software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

PIVX Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.


Notable Changes
==============

Startup Fixes + Performance Improvements
--------------------------

There was a regression in the wallet startup flow causing an excessively growing time based on the amount of stored transactions. In the extreme situation of a wallet with 400k transactions, for example, it was taking over an hour.

4.0.1 fixes it and includes several performance improvements in the wallet's startup flow.

Test: 

Environment: 

Wallet with 450,000 transactions.

Time:

3.4.0 ---> ~14 minutes.
4.0.0 ---> +60 minutes.
4.0.1 --->  ~8 minutes ðŸš€  .

NOTE: Currently the GUI interface only loads the **latest 20k** transaction records. A "load-on-demand" feature for such big wallets will be provided in a future release.

GUI Enable Smaller Window Resize
--------------------------

There was a request from many users about our GUI window not fitting in their less than 13 inches screens.

4.0.1 implemented a scrolled navigation bar and permit to decrease the screen height up to 620 px (4.0.0 minimum was 740px). Solving, in this way, the small devices fitting issue.

GUI Masternodes Locked Balance Bug Fix.
--------------------------

There was a bug in 4.0.0 not showing the locked balance (Masternodes collateral utxo) in the topbar's available balance. 4.0.1 fixed it.

GUI Masternodes Start all and Start Missing flows.
--------------------------

The new Masternodes GUI is now implementing the Start all and Start missing flows.

RPC/GUI Rework staking status
--------------------------

Fixed bug with staking icon off while the wallet is actually staking.
Improved staking status detection and expanded `getstakingstatus` output.

Account System Deprecation
--------------------------

The internal accounting system is planned for removal in a future version. As such, this release contains notations in RPC help texts that state it's deprecation.

Some instances of the term "account" are rather loose, and possibly technically incorrect (confusing "label" with "account"). These instances will be corrected in a subsequent pull request.

Functional Test Suite Overhaul
------------------------------

Our Regression/Functional testing suite has undergone a substantial overhaul, particularly in regards to the cached chain that can be used to speed up testing. Full details can be found in the description of [#1218](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/1218).

Further Zerocoin Code Cleanup
------------------------------

Initial cleanup work towards a clean zerocoin code sources. 4.1.0 will continue and finish this work.
The house needs to be organized for 5.0.0 new privacy protocol.

RPC Changes
-----------

### `getstakingstatus`

The `staking_status` is now the first attribute.
`validtime` has been removed and replaced with `tiptime` (displaying the time of the current block at the tip of the chain). Fixed `enoughcoins` attribute and added the following:
 - `staking_enabled` (whether staking is enabled via conf file / startup flag)
 - `hashLastStakeAttempt` (hash of the block on top of which the last stake attempt was made)
 - `heightLastStakeAttempt` (height of the block on top of which the last stake attempt was made)
 - `timeLastStakeAttempt` (time of the last stake attempt)

### `delegatoradd`

This command now takes an additional optional argument (string: `label`) that allows associating a label with the added owner address in the address book.

### `listdelegators`

This command now takes an optional argument (boolean: `fBlacklist`) that allows the command to show only owner addresses that have been removed from the whitelist (done by using the `delegatorremove` command).

The default behavior of this command if the new argument isn't provided remains the same as before.

### `importprivkey` and `importaddress`

Added support for cold-staking addresses.
